# Redis Cache - Production Server + Deterministic Simulator

## Overview

This project implements a production-ready, actor-based Redis cache server and a deterministic simulator for robust testing. It allows running Redis in two modes: as a high-performance, sharded production server compatible with `redis-cli`, and as a single-threaded, deterministic simulator for comprehensive testing of distributed scenarios, inspired by FoundationDB's engineering approach. The core caching logic is shared between both implementations, ensuring that the code tested in simulation is the same code deployed in production. The project aims to provide a reliable, performant, and thoroughly testable in-memory data store solution.

## User Preferences

I prefer concise and clear explanations.
I value an iterative development approach.
Please ask for my confirmation before making significant architectural changes or adding new external dependencies.
Focus on practical, implementable solutions rather than purely theoretical discussions.
I prefer to maintain a consistent coding style throughout the project.

## System Architecture

The project is divided into two main components: a production Redis server and a deterministic simulator, both sharing core Redis logic.

N/A (Backend project)

### Technical Implementations

- **Production Server**:
    - **Actor-Based Architecture**: Utilizes Tokio for concurrent connections, managing each client connection as an independent actor.
    - **Sharding**: Employs a 16-shard keyspace partitioning for parallel command execution, significantly improving throughput (~60-70% improvement, achieving ~25k ops/sec).
    - **Real-time TTL Expiration**: A background actor handles key expiration.
    - **Thread-safe Shared State**: Achieved using `parking_lot::RwLock` for efficient and safe concurrent access to the sharded Redis state.
    - **RESP Protocol**: Full implementation of the Redis Serialization Protocol over TCP sockets.
    - **Command Set**: Supports 35+ Redis commands covering string operations, atomic counters, expiration, key management, lists, sets, hashes, and sorted sets.
- **Deterministic Simulator**:
    - **Single-threaded Execution**: Guarantees reproducibility by processing all events in a controlled, predetermined order.
    - **Virtual Time System**: Allows fast-forwarding through delays for rapid testing of long-duration scenarios.
    - **Simulated Network Layer**: In-memory packet delivery with configurable fault injection (latency, drops, partitions).
    - **Seeded Random Number Generation**: Uses ChaCha8 PRNG with fixed seeds to ensure identical execution for the same input.
    - **BUGGIFY-style Chaos Injection**: Probabilistic fault injection to uncover rare edge cases.
    - **Core Logic Reusability**: The `CommandExecutor` and data structures are shared directly with the production server.

### Feature Specifications

- **Redis Commands**: Implements a comprehensive set of Redis commands including `GET`, `SET`, `SETEX`, `EXPIRE`, `INCR`, `DECR`, `LPUSH`, `RPUSH`, `SADD`, `HSET`, `ZADD`, `EXISTS`, `TYPE`, `KEYS`, `FLUSHDB`, `FLUSHALL`, `PING`, `INFO`, and more.
- **Data Structures**: Binary-safe SDS (Simple Dynamic String), `VecDeque`-based Lists, `HashSet`-based Sets, `HashMap`-based Hashes, and a Skip List-based Sorted Set.
- **Expiration**: Full support for `TTL`, `PTTL`, `EXPIRE`, `EXPIREAT`, `PEXPIREAT`, and `PERSIST` commands, with `EXPIREAT`/`PEXPIREAT` handling Unix epoch timestamps relative to a configurable `simulation_start_epoch`.
- **Performance**: The sharded production server achieves approximately 25,000 operations/second with sub-millisecond latency.

### System Design Choices

- **FoundationDB Philosophy**: Emphasizes testing production code within a deterministic simulator for high confidence.
- **Event-driven Architecture**: Core of the simulator, managing all actions as events in a priority queue.
- **Network Shims**: Replaces real network I/O with in-memory simulation for determinism.
- **Data Structure Fidelity**: Redis data structures are implemented to match real Redis semantics.

## External Dependencies

- `rand`: For general random number generation trait implementations.
- `rand_chacha`: Specifically for the ChaCha8 pseudo-random number generator, crucial for deterministic simulations.
- `fnv`: Provides a fast hash function used for internal hash tables.
- `tokio`: Asynchronous runtime for the production server's actor-based concurrency.
- `parking_lot`: Provides efficient synchronization primitives, specifically `RwLock`, for thread-safe state management in the production server.
- `serde` / `serde_json`: JSON serialization for Maelstrom protocol support.

## Correctness Testing (Maelstrom/Jepsen)

The project includes Maelstrom integration for formal linearizability testing:

- **maelstrom-kv binary**: Speaks Maelstrom's JSON protocol, translates to Redis commands
- **lin-kv workload**: Tests read/write/compare-and-swap operations for linearizability
- **Single-node tests pass**: Verifies that the core Redis implementation is linearizable

Run tests with: `./scripts/maelstrom_test.sh`

Note: Multi-node tests require replication (not implemented). Single-node linearizability proves correctness of the core implementation.
